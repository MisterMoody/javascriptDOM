# Working in the DOM

This project highlights key aspects of using JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and it is geared for coders of an elementary level. 

The process of working in the DOM amalgamates the selection of `html` elements, passing the selector to an `event listener` and adding a `function` to the listener. 

Commonly used `methods` and `properties` are detailed while function examples are provided to illustrate how the code works.
